example Training data....

LET US ASSUME THAT THE THIS DATA WAS COLLECTED FROM PAST 6 GAMES PLAYED BEFORE ....

RANDOM VARIABLE
 1.weather={sunny,cloudy};
 2.play={yes,no};
 In program hypothesis are labled as...
 sunny--->   1;
 cloudy-->   2;
 yes----->  -1;
 no------>  -2
 when you run the program..it will show a matrix.. called label matrix ...find there..
 Now here is the data set....
   
    weather= | play=
		sunny|yes
	   cloudy|no
	   sunny |yes
	   cloudy|yes
	   sunny |yes
	   cloudy|no
	   
So this is the data set over which program is demonstrated....
